        <h4>A Message From Our Founder</h4>
        <p>As our company enters its twentieth year of operation, I am reminded of just how awesome our journey has been and how awesome the future looks for our company. I am also reminded of those who have devoted themselves to getting us here. I am grateful to our many supporters, investors, technical partners and suppliers who have stood by us through the difficult and lean years. Yes, there have been many obstacles to overcome and many challenges still ahead, but we have managed to stay focused and committed to our purpose, goals and to our core values. Our pipeline of projects is quite impressive and now stands at over $19 billion USD, and it continues to expand. I look forward to each and every project being built knowing that the people we serve will soon have an abundant source of clean energy, clean water and clean air. I look forward to providing meaningful, long-term employment for thousands of people, especially in areas where jobs are badly needed. I invite you to read our Corporate Profile and to learn about our people and our technologies. Remember the name “Naanovo” as you will soon see this name in every corner of our planet, bringing renewable energy to those who need it most.</p>
