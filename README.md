<h1>NAANOVO</h1>
<h4>Completed January 2021</h4>
<br>
<p>This client wanted their site to be based on a PDF of their company offerings, so the branding and content was already in place. I drafted some extra designs for the layout so that the translation from PDF to site made sense, and users could make their way through easily with links and menus.</p>
<p>This was created using mainly HTML and CSS, with a small amount of Javascript for the mobile menu.</p>
